[Demo](http://ptv-logistics.github.io/xserverjs/premium-samples/admin-regions/)

Administrative regions are polygons defined by the borders of administrative units. These units can be countries, districts or postal code areas. Administrative regions can be utilized for many helpful use cases:

* Visualize administrative borders
* Aggregate your location data based on adminitrative regions
* Create thematic (Choropleth) maps. These visualize quntitative data like 
[population density,](http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/) 
[purchasing power](http://176.95.37.29/coveragedemo/) or individual sales per region.
* Define custom regions by merging underlyig admin regions (Todo: show TopoJSON/union)

Our partner [digital data services gmbh](http://www.ddsgeo.de/) provides both geography and the corresponding socio-economic data in various formats. The most popular format is [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/). GeoJSON can be processed directly in JavaScript and Leaflet, 
and also [directly displayed in GitHub](https://github.com/ptv-logistics/xserverjs/blob/master/premium-samples/admin-regions/data/municipalities.json)!

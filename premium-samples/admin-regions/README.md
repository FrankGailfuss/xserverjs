Administrative Regions
======================

Our partner [digital data services gmbh](http://www.ddsgeo.de/) provides both geography and the corresponding socio-economic data in various formats. The most popular format is [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/). GeoJSON can be processed directly in JavaScript and Leaflet, and also [be directly displayed in GitHub](https://github.com/ptv-logistics/xserverjs/blob/master/premium-samples/admin-regions/data/municipalities.json)!

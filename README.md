==========

JavaScript APIs for [PTV xServer](http://xserver.ptvgroup.com/home/ptv-xserver-en/)

Go to https://ptv-logistics.github.io/xserverjs/ 

To run the project locally:
* Clone it or download the zip file
* Add your xserver-internet token at token.js
* To use samples with your on-premise xServer, replace the urls in the corresponding index.html file for your xServer url.
* Some samples need to access local files via ajax. Chrome and IE block this. Either use FireFox or run the sample from a WebServer folder.
